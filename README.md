This is the project that Iwill be submitting for my second task in the HNG intenship.

This is basically a simple app that displays prefilled details of a  Curriculum vitae. 

On navigation to the edit page, one is able to edit all the fields and on saving, the updated details are now visible on the home page.

The app works well on both web and mobile (android).

I am on flutter version 3.13.2.

and Dart version 3.1.0.

I have no minSDK version defined for my app.
